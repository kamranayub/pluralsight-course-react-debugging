## Notes

### Setting up the React Dev Tools Extension (unpacked)

To ensure consistency with the course, I've included the unpacked
React Dev Tools extension (`react-devtools-extension_4_25_0_0.zip`)
you can load into your browser under Developer Mode.

Unzip it to any folder you want and then [follow the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII) to load an unpacked extension (Chrome).

This is because there was an issue with v4.27.0+ of the Dev Tools
that made it unstable during course creation.
