## React Bug Shop

As a companion learning experience to the course, this repository has the source for the React Bug Shop demo app.

You can use the [1-click Dev Container setup](https://codespaces.new/kamranayub/pluralsight-course-react-debugging) to create a GitHub Codespaces that will let you modify, update, and play with the demo app to solve its challenges.

[Open live demo site](https://reactbugs.shop)

### Solve the Challenges

The goal is to catch all the bugs in the shop. Each bug comes with a set of checks you need to make pass. You'll need to refactor and update the code.

The exercise files in this repo along with the videos in the course provide the solutions to each challenge but there are often multiple ways to solve a problem with React. If you're stuck, reference the videos or explore on your own!

### Running Locally

To run the Bug Shop demo locally, you will need Node.js 16+ installed. 

Clone the repository then in the `demo` folder, run:

    npm install
    npm start
