# Getting Started with the React Bug Shop Demo

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/kamranayub/pluralsight-course-react-debugging)

The fastest way to jump into the demo experience and solve the challenges is by running in the GitHub Codespace which is a preconfigured development environment with everything you need to follow along with the course.

Once you're in, simply run:

    npm start

To start the dev server, and Codespaces will prompt you to open a hosted URL in the browser to view the app.

Alternatively, you can clone the project locally and configure your own local dev environment.

## Solving the Challenges

The goal is to catch all the bugs in the shop. Each bug comes with a set of checks you need to make pass. You'll need to refactor and update the code.

The videos in the course provide the solutions to each challenge but there are often multiple ways to solve a problem with React. If you're stuck, reference the videos or explore on your own!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
