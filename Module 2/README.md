# Module 2: Introducing the React Developer Tools

## Setting up the React Dev Tools Extension (unpacked)

The React Dev Tools v4.27.8+ should be fairly stable. There are some known issues that can usually be resolved by opening/re-opening the dev tools multiple times.

However, for good measure, I've included the unpacked React Dev Tools extension ([`react-devtools-extension_4_25_0_0.zip`](react-devtools-extension_4_25_0_0.zip)) you can load into your browser under Developer Mode.

Unzip it to any folder you want and then [follow the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhaGRJvJAII) to load an unpacked extension (Chrome).

This is because there was an issue with v4.27.0+ of the Dev Tools
that made it unstable during course creation.
